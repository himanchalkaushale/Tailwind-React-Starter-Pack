# Tailwind CSS + React Starter Pack

This is a starter pack for building React applications with Tailwind CSS. It's pre-configured with a basic project structure and the necessary dependencies to get you up and running quickly.

## Features

*   **React 19:** The latest version of the popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Tailwind CSS 4:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
*   **Vite:** A fast and lightweight build tool for modern web projects.
*   **ESLint:** A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your computer.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/himanchalkaushale/Tailwind-React-Starter-Pack.git
    ```
                Or
    [Download](https://github.com/himanchalkaushale/Tailwind-React-Starter-Pack/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) this repo as a zip
3.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Tailwind-React-Starter-Pack
    ```

4.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and open the application in your default browser at `http://localhost:5173`. The server will automatically reload as you make changes to the source files.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

*   `npm run dev`: Runs the app in the development mode.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
*   `npm run lint`: Lints the project files using ESLint.
*   `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for previewing.
